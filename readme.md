#### Data engineering project
This is originally an R project to develop scripts that take a zipped file of 300+ location sensor data files, merges them and runs a few simple statistical functions on them. Ported to Python as well, to compare code style and experiment with efficiency of the scripts to run this kind of file-based data manipulation.
